# Mobile App Development

## My initial idea was to continue a previous project and create an iOS version of it. In my CS Capstone we used Android Studio and Kotlin to create a digital wallet that would allow users to send and receive money as well as participate in Tandas without the need for a bank account. The idea initially came to mind when one of my peers identified a problem in Mexico as almost 50% of the population don't have access to the digital economy and deal exclusively with cash. We wanted to create something that would allow them to participate in the modern economy wihtout having to change too many habits. Future versions of the app were to include Employer payroll, Online bill payments and more. Here are some screenshots of a prototype:
